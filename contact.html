			<p>This may come as a shock to you but this site was actually created by me, <span class="green">TheSaltBoy</span>, to promote myself and my amazing skills. 
			<br><br>	
			You've probably noticed that you can't actually buy anything on this site. This was a calculated plan you see (I also don't have a Shopify or Paypal account).
			<br><br>
				If you like what you see here - and let's be real, of course you do - then you can find me on <a class="green" href="www.instagram.com/thesaltboy/">Instagram</a> or <a class="green" href="www.thesaltboy.tumblr.com">Tumblr</a>.
			<br><br>
			And if you want to hire me for a job (please dear god hire me) then you can email me at <span class="green">glenbnelsoniii@gmail.com</span>.
