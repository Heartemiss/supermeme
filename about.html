		<div class="about">
			<p>In October 2018, Supermeme opened its doors to the Internet-at-large. It quickly became the home of pure Internet culture. At its core were memes. Memes and animals. Along for the ride was the gang of rebellious and opressed gamers who became this site's customers, converts, and missionaries.
			<br><br>
			Supermeme is the epitome of true Internet superiority. Cat videos are old and busted, Superb Cat Icons are the new hotness. Youtubers, Redditors, Fortnite Streamers - the internet counter-culture at large - all gravitate towards Supermeme. Are you going to let them leave you behind?
			<br><br>
			As it became a worldwide online phenomenon, Supermeme established itself as a brand known for its quality, style, and a e s t h e t i c.
			<br><br>
			Over its three month history, Supermeme has worked with some of the world's greatest illustrators and web design students. Well, really only one. Me. Just me. All of whom have helped to define its unique identity and attitude.
